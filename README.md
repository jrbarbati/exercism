# Exercism

My solutions to exercises on <a href="https://exercism.io" target="_blank">exercism.io</a>

Currently learning Go, C++, Swift, and C

** Disclaimer -- I do not write the tests, but I simulate TDD by ignoring tests until I get the unignored tests passing.

What did I write?
<ul>
	<li>Go</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Any file that does not end in "_test.go"</li>
	</ul>
	<li>C++</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Files that are named after the folder and are .h or .cpp</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Swift</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Files in Sources/*/ folder</li>
	</ul>
	<li>C</li>
	<ul>
		<li>All .c files in src/ folder and most .h files in src/ folder</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
